We physically decouple the Mobile Base (Logistics) from the Manipulator (Dexterity), allowing sub-teams to develop against agreed-upon interfaces. Operating on an agile 2-week sprint cycle with a simulation-first approach using NVIDIA Isaac Lab, teams iterate rapidly and safely before deploying to real hardware."

                            Current robotic systems often perform repetitive tasks with super-human precision but fail when faced with novel objects or unscripted environments. DyNAMO moves away from hard-coded behaviors towards learning-based approaches that emphasize true <strong>understanding</strong>.

                        <p>
                            Our capstone goal is to construct an <strong>Integrated Test Environment</strong> where Ridgeback and G1 robots operate simultaneously amidst animated human characters in a unified simulation — then transfer those capabilities to the real world.
