                                            This semester we will offer the following projects:

                                                <b>Development of an LLM Training & Evaluation Environment in the GenAI Cluster.</b>
                                                {' '}In this project you will design and deploy the infrastructure to train, fine-tune, and rigorously evaluate Large Language Models on the GenAI Labs new EUR 400 000 GPU cluster, which combines state-of-the-art NVIDIA H200 GPUs with other high-performance accelerators.
                                                Together with your team you will build a platform that captures real-time GPU, memory, network, and power metrics, make them available through intuitive dashboards, and configure automated alerting systems.
                                                You will craft reproducible benchmarks for key workloads—from inference to fine-tuning, so results across models and hardware can be compared.
                                                By the end of the semester you will know how to deliver production-grade MLOps tooling.

                                                <b>Large Language Models for Text-Based Games.</b>
                                                <br />
                                                In this project you develop a Large Language Model (LLM) agent that is capable of self-improvement in strategy-games.
                                                Specifically, you will develop an Artificial Intelligence for the two-player strategy game Stratego.
                                                Working in a cross-institutional team with students from Babes-Bolyai University, you will gain hands-on experience with LLM deployment (e.g., model parallelism, compression, activation checkpointing) and cutting-edge self-improvement methods which include reinforcement learning, self-play, exploration strategies, and advanced model analysis.
