                                                <p>
                                                    Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating computer programs from high-level descriptions, such as input-output examples. This is often called Programming by Example (PBE). To make the search for correct programs easier, many systems use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which defines a set of operations the program can use.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In this thesis, you will explore whether using a DSL causes models to overfit to the training tasks. DSLs are usually designed based on the training data, so models might learn how to solve those tasks well but struggle with different, unseen tasks. This becomes a problem if the test tasks require different combinations of operations or are simply harder to express with the given DSL.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    You will design controlled experiments to test this hypothesis. One idea is to change the length or complexity of the test tasks to make them different from the training tasks. This will help us understand how well DSL-based models can generalize and whether they are too specialized for the training distribution.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    Most current approaches in programming-by-example (PBE)—where a program is learned from input-output examples—are evaluated using a single metric: the number of test tasks they solve correctly (i.e., accuracy). However, this alone does not tell us how good or meaningful the generated programs really are. For example, two models might solve the same task, but with completely different and unequally readable or generalizable solutions.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In this thesis, you will develop an evaluation library that goes beyond accuracy. You will implement both quantitative metrics (e.g., how similar the predicted program is to a reference solution) and qualitative metrics (e.g., how well the solution matches the task intent). The goal is to create a richer evaluation framework for comparing PBE models.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Once the metrics are implemented, you will use them to analyze and compare the behavior of state-of-the-art systems. This will help identify strengths, weaknesses, and differences between models that accuracy alone cannot reveal.

                                                <p>
                                                    Physical Guards is a research-driven smart home project that aggregates sensor data to detect anomalies and potential security threats within residential environments. The current system processes data locally and visualizes alerts through a basic GUI. However, to support broader usability and improve situational awareness, the system requires both a more advanced interface and additional functionalities.

                                                <p>
                                                    This thesis focuses on improving the existing GUI by making it more intuitive, informative, and responsive to real-time data. Moreover, it aims to transition the current local setup into a secure web application, enabling remote access and monitoring. Students will work on integrating sensor data streams, implementing real-time alert mechanisms, and enhancing the overall user experience. Additional features such as event history, customizable alert settings, and multi-user support can be explored based on interest and scope.

                                                <summary>Evaluating LLM-Based Generation of Full-Stack Applications from Natural Language Requirements</summary>
                                                <p>
                                                    The rapid evolution of software development tools has enabled the automatic generation of user interfaces from low- to high-fidelity prototypes. However, these approaches typically result in front-end prototypes with limited or no backend functionality, restricting their practical applicability. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for generating not only front-end interfaces but also complete backend systems directly from natural language requirements.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This bachelor thesis explores and evaluates the effectiveness of current LLMs in generating full-stack applications, including both the backend logic and its integration with the generated front end. Given a collection of requirements described in natural language, the approach aims to automatically produce a functional application that satisfies the specified requirements. The evaluation should be conducted using multiple requirements datasets, assessing the generated applications in terms of correctness, completeness, and integration quality. Furthermore, the thesis systematically investigates and categorizes the typical errors made by LLMs during the generation process. This work provides insights into both the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven full-stack generation, contributing to the advancement of automated software engineering.

                                                <p>
                                                    BugPlus is a minimalist, Turing-complete programming language loosely inspired by marble-logic games like Turing Tumble. A bug is a stateful element that can be connected to other bugs and perform simple additions. When an input signal fires, the bug performs a math operation and forwards the result to the next connected bug. Entire programs are directed graphs of bugbits: the first bugbit receives the only external input; all subsequent activity is determined by wiring and internal states.

                                                    Because of its simplicity yet non-trivial behaviour, BugPlus is a compelling playground for teaching digital-logic concepts, exploring program synthesis, and potentially benchmarking reasoning in Large Language Models. Currently, however, no comprehensive tooling exists for humans to lay out, simulate, and debug BugPlus programs.

                                                    P.R.O.G.R.E.S.S. is intended as an Isaac Sim extension for procedurally generating a wide variety of wheeled mobile robots. In this thesis, you will focus on developing the GUI-based extension, with an emphasis on interactive construction and configuration of mobile robots. The core objective is to support the generation of diverse sets of agents to facilitate the training of deep learning models that can generalize across varying robot configurations and control dynamics.

                                                    The envisioned system allows users to design SIMPLE mobile robot models by combining basic geometric shapes (e.g., boxes, cylinders) to define the body structure, and to optionally add joints where articulation is desired—such as for arms, grippers, or sensor mounts.

                                                <p>
                                                    It is expected to support detailed configuration of wheel parameters, including the number of wheels, their placement on the chassis, whether each wheel is steerable or fixed, and relevant control properties (e.g., maximum steering angle).

                                                <p>
                                                    The system should automatically generate all required files (e.g., USD and URDF), making the robots compatible with Isaac Sim and exportable to other simulators.

                                                    The Explain Reality project aims to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art AI and immersive augmented reality by deploying foundation models such as segmentation and object detection directly on the Meta Quest 3. A first prototype has demonstrated the feasibility of running these models on-device and recognizing objects and regions in the user’s environment.

The goal is to enable users not just to view visual detections, but to actively engage with their surroundings—asking for explanations about specific objects, receiving contextual information, and navigating their environment through natural interaction.

This thesis is ideal for students excited about building real-world applications at the intersection of machine learning, XR (extended reality), and human-AI interaction.

                                                    MotherNet is a recent hypernetwork-based approach designed to generate entire neural networks in a single forward pass, enabling efficient in-context learning on new tabular datasets without task-specific gradient descent. While this approach has shown promising results in terms of speed and predictive accuracy, its reliance on standard neural architectures limits interpretability and structural flexibility.

                                                    This thesis explores an extension of the MotherNet framework to alternative model representations — such as recursive programs, symbolic rules, or decision trees — with the goal of enabling fast, gradient-free generation of interpretable models. We investigate how to reformulate the decoder of the hypernetwork to emit structured programs or tree-based models, and evaluate the trade-offs in performance, interpretability, and generalization.

                                                <p>
                                                    The increasing complexity of software systems necessitates robust and efficient methods for requirements verification to ensure system reliability and compliance. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in automating various software engineering tasks. This thesis investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of LLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents for the automated verification of software requirements. Given requirements in natural language (e.g., a collection of user stories) and an implemented interactive GUI-based system, the approach should validate the correct implementation of the requirements. Through a series of experiments on multiple requirements datasets, the proposed approach should be assessed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. This work should contribute to the field by providing a novel framework and practical insights for adopting LLM-driven agents in requirements engineering processes.

                                                    Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents capable of reasoning, decision-making across multiple steps. However, the internal mechanisms and the extent to which LLMs can perform agent-like behavior—such as maintaining goals, updating beliefs, or planning — remain poorly understood.

                                                    Autoformalization aims to translate informal mathematical text into formal proofs, a key challenge in AI-assisted theorem proving. This thesis investigates how existing library learning techniques, e.g. [1,3], impact the effectiveness and efficiency of autoformalization when integrated with Large Language Models and program synthesis. The goal is to evaluate their ability to reuse previously generated lemmas and improve proof success rates. The study will use benchmark datasets like miniF2F and MATH and compare against baselines without library learning. Results will inform the practical value and limitations of library learning [2] in formal reasoning systems.
