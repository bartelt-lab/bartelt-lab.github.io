                                                <p>
                                                    Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating computer programs from high-level descriptions, such as input-output examples. This is often called Programming by Example (PBE). To make the search for correct programs easier, many systems use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which defines a set of operations the program can use.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In this thesis, you will explore whether using a DSL causes models to overfit to the training tasks. DSLs are usually designed based on the training data, so models might learn how to solve those tasks well but struggle with different, unseen tasks. This becomes a problem if the test tasks require different combinations of operations or are simply harder to express with the given DSL.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    You will design controlled experiments to test this hypothesis. One idea is to change the length or complexity of the test tasks to make them different from the training tasks. This will help us understand how well DSL-based models can generalize and whether they are too specialized for the training distribution.

                                                <p>
                                                    Most current approaches in programming-by-example (PBE)—where a program is learned from input-output examples—are evaluated using a single metric: the number of test tasks they solve correctly (i.e., accuracy). However, this alone does not tell us how good or meaningful the generated programs really are. For example, two models might solve the same task, but with completely different and unequally readable or generalizable solutions.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In this thesis, you will develop an evaluation library that goes beyond accuracy. You will implement both quantitative metrics (e.g., how similar the predicted program is to a reference solution) and qualitative metrics (e.g., how well the solution matches the task intent). The goal is to create a richer evaluation framework for comparing PBE models.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Once the metrics are implemented, you will use them to analyze and compare the behavior of state-of-the-art systems. This will help identify strengths, weaknesses, and differences between models that accuracy alone cannot reveal.

                                                <p>
                                                    Physical Guards is a research-driven smart home project that aggregates sensor data to detect anomalies and potential security threats within residential environments. The current system processes data locally and visualizes alerts through a basic GUI. However, to support broader usability and improve situational awareness, the system requires both a more advanced interface and additional functionalities.

                                                <p>
                                                    This thesis focuses on improving the existing GUI by making it more intuitive, informative, and responsive to real-time data. Moreover, it aims to transition the current local setup into a secure web application, enabling remote access and monitoring. Students will work on integrating sensor data streams, implementing real-time alert mechanisms, and enhancing the overall user experience. Additional features such as event history, customizable alert settings, and multi-user support can be explored based on interest and scope.

                                                <p>
                                                    The rapid evolution of software development tools has enabled the automatic generation of user interfaces from low- to high-fidelity prototypes. However, these approaches typically result in front-end prototypes with limited or no backend functionality, restricting their practical applicability. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for generating not only front-end interfaces but also complete backend systems directly from natural language requirements.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This thesis will evaluate the capabilities and limitations of current LLM-based approaches for generating full-stack applications. You will design and implement a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses both the functional correctness and the architectural quality of generated applications. The evaluation will cover aspects such as code quality, security, performance, and adherence to best practices.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    You will also explore different prompting strategies and their impact on the quality of generated applications. The goal is to provide insights into how LLMs can be effectively used for rapid prototyping and development of complete software systems.

                                                <p>
                                                    Program synthesis models are typically trained on datasets that may not be representative of real-world usage patterns. This thesis will investigate how the distribution of training data affects model performance and generalization capabilities.

                                                    You will analyze existing datasets, identify potential biases, and design experiments to test how different training distributions affect model behavior. This includes investigating the impact of task complexity, domain specificity, and data augmentation strategies.

                                                    The goal is to provide insights into how to design better training datasets and improve the robustness of program synthesis models for real-world applications.

                                                <p>
                                                    Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating code, but their performance on multi-modal software engineering tasks (involving code, documentation, diagrams, and user interfaces) remains largely unexplored.

                                                    This thesis will investigate how LLMs can be enhanced to handle multi-modal inputs in software engineering contexts. You will explore techniques for integrating different modalities, evaluate model performance on multi-modal tasks, and develop benchmarks for assessing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

                                                    The research will contribute to understanding how LLMs can be effectively used for complex software engineering tasks that require reasoning across multiple types of information.
