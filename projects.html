                The European Master Team Project offers an exciting opportunity for students to collaborate internationally while working on real-world challenges. 
                This long-standing program is a partnership between the Technical University of Clausthal and Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, 
                led by Prof. Dr. Christian Bartelt.

                          From October 10, 2025 to January 30, 2026, students from both universities will work in interdisciplinary teams on innovative projects at the intersection 
                          of computer science and engineering. Collaboration takes place primarily online, with regular team meetings, milestone reviews, and mentor check-ins.

                    This semester we will offer the following projects:

                    <br>
                    <br>
                      
                      <p>
                        <b>Development of an LLM Training & Evaluation Environment in the GenAI Cluster.</b>
                        
                        In this project you will design and deploy the infrastructure to train, fine-tune, and rigorously evaluate Large Language Models on the GenAI Labs new EUR 400 000 GPU cluster, which combines state-of-the-art NVIDIA H200 GPUs with other high-performance accelerators. 
                        Together with your team you will build a platform that captures real-time GPU, memory, network, and power metrics, make them available through intuitive dashboards, and configure automated alerting systems. 
                        You will craft reproducible benchmarks for key workloadsâ€”from inference to fine-tuning, so results across models and hardware can be compared. 
                        By the end of the semester you will know how to deliver production-grade MLOps tooling. 
                        These skills translate directly to state-of-the-art research and industry practice, giving you a strong foundation for any role that demands working with large-scale AI infrastructure.
 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Large Language Models for Text-Based Games.</b>
                        <br>
                        In this project you develop a Large Language Model (LLM) agent that is capable of self-improvement in strategy-games. 
                        Specifically, you will develop an Artificial Intelligence for the two-player strategy game Stratego. 
                        Working in a cross-institutional team with students from Babes-Bolyai University, you will gain hands-on experience with LLM deployment (e.g., model parallelism, compression, activation checkpointing) and cutting-edge self-improvement methods which include reinforcement learning, self-play, exploration strategies, and advanced model analysis. 
                        You will receive access to necessary compute ressources, be coached by your supervisors, and explore either Retrieval-Augmented Generation or Supervised Finetuning as learning paradigms. 
                        After the project, you will be able to set up your own agents and experiment with different architectures which are both skills that become increasingly important in academia and industry.
